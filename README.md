#### About

```
I took part in a hackathon last year with a group of girls, and though we didn't finish the project, we coded hundreds of lines of React during the two day program.
This is simply to keep all the code that we worked on in one place in case we ever wish to go back to it and finish what we started, or in case I wish to keep working on it on my own.
